/*
The IGamePluginService interface is used to define the methods that a game plugin service must implement.
The start method is used to start the game plugin service, and the stop method is used to stop the game plugin service.
These methods take the game data and world as parameters, allowing the game plugin service to interact with the game data
and world during its execution.
